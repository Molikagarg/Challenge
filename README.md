# Challenge 1
A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.
_I have created main resources required in a 3-tier environment using Azure CLI, wherein we have 
WebApp - UI/ Web layer
Virtual Machine (Server) - Business layer
CosmosDB - Data Layer_

Challenge #2

We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within AWS and provide a json formatted output. The choice of language and implementation is up to you.
Bonus Points
The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually.
_Retrived the metadata of an instance on an Azure VM using powershell. _

Challenge #3

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
